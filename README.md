# GameState

## Introduction

**GameState** is an esolang inspired by classic video game mechanics created by Wilber Escobar in 06/2026.  
The core idea behind this language is to simulate a video game through codeâ€”where each instruction represents an in-game event or action. Programs unfold like interactive narratives, allowing you to "play" through a sequence of game-like states and watch the story evolve as the code executes.

## Computational Class

**GameState** is Turing complete.


It can simulate a Turing machine, and its commands can be mapped to Brainfuck (BF) equivalents as follows:

| GameState                                                                 | Brainfuck Equivalent | Notes                                                 |
